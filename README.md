## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project provided me with a valuable opportunity to refresh my CSS and HTML skills after several months of not working with these languages. Although it was a simple project, I thoroughly enjoyed the process and it reminded me of how fun and immersive coding can be.

Working on this project not only helped me regain my confidence in front-end development but also reignited my passion for creating engaging web experiences.

### Continued development

As I continue to develop my skills, I want to focus on perfecting my CSS and HTML abilities. Specifically, I aim to adopt a more structured approach to writing code. While I appreciate the learning that comes from a trial-and-error method, I believe that being more methodical in my coding practices will lead to cleaner, more maintainable code and a deeper understanding of best practices.

By focusing on these areas, I hope to enhance my overall efficiency and effectiveness as a developer, ultimately leading to better project outcomes.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Malven] (https://flexbox.malven.co) - This helped me refreshing my flexbox knowledge. A very intuitive and simple cheatsheet for flexbox.

- [CSS Tricks] (https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me with some CSS Properties I wasn't acquainted with.

- [Chrome Developer Tools] (no links) - This sounds like a no-brainer, but using developer tools can prove quite useful when it comes to troubleshooting our code.
